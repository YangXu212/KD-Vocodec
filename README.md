## About KD-Vocodec

KD-Vocodec is a neural speech codec that achieves joint speech coding and enhancement through feature-level knowledge distillation. Our approach employs a teacher-student framework where a compact student encoder learns to reconstruct clean speech representations from noisy inputs by mimicking a pre-trained teacher encoder.

### Key Highlights

- **Low Complexity**: 1.28G MACs | 12.65M parameters
- **Low Latency**: 30ms algorithmic latency
- **Scalable Bitrates**: 1-6 kbps
- **Robust Performance**: Built-in noise suppression and dereverberation
- **No Pre-trained Models**: Trained from scratch without external dependencies

### Technical Innovation

Unlike conventional cascaded enhancement-then-coding pipelines, KD-Vocodec performs enhancement at the feature level before quantization. This ensures that the limited codebook capacity is dedicated to encoding speech content rather than noise patterns, resulting in superior reconstruction quality and robustness at ultra-low bitrates.

## Demo Content

This website showcases audio samples demonstrating KD-Vocodec's performance across different conditions:

**Bitrates**: 1 kbps (ultra-low) | 6 kbps (low)
**Acoustic Conditions**: Clean | Noisy | Reverberant
**Comparison**: Original (degraded) | KD-Vocodec (reconstructed) | Target (clean reference)
